numPadRadios
============

This is a simple Lua plugin (thanks Barry for the idea) to assist with tuning the radios and setting the transponder in FSX using  the numpad of your keyboard. A registered copy of FSUIPC4 is needed for it to work, and it's programmed for the default FSX radios and transponder. It may not work with A/C with additional logic programmed into the radios. It consists of: -1 optional key to toggle the pluggin on/off - 4 configurable keys to select the device to be edited (COM1 &amp; 2, NAV 1 &amp; 2, ADF1 &amp; 2 and SQK for the transponder) - 10 configurable keys for the 0 - 9 digits and the decimal  '.' dot - 1 configurable key to reset- restart editing frequencies or squawk codes - 1 configurable standby key to swap frequencies in the currently selected device where applies (COM &amp; NAV).
